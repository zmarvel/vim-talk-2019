Hi, I'm Zack Marvel. I've been working on MCS since I started at Ball, around a
year ago. Today I'm going to talk about the Vim editor and hopefully help you
understand how to do things in Vim that you can already do in your favorite
editor.


I have a few questions for you, just to get a feel for how familiar you
already are with Vim.

- How many people have no idea what Vim is?
- How many people have never used Vim before?
- How many people use it at least once a month?
- At least once a week?
- How many prefer Vim to other editors?


Even if Vim isn't your daily driver, when you have to edit a file on a remote
Linux system, it's just about always there. I want to convince you that, even
without any plugins, Vim is a very complete editor for C and C++ development.

We're gonna cover a lot of topics, and I don't expect you to ingest everything
on these slides. I just want you to be aware of these features, and you can
refer to these slides or another cheatsheet in the future.
